## Description

I created this application to give end users the capability to view, create, and track daily workouts. You can even log more than one exercise within a single workout. You can track each exercise's name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration. If the exercise is cardio, you can track the distance traveled and duration as well. This web application helps end users reach their fitness goals more quickly and helps them keep up with their routine.
